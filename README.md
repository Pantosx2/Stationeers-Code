# Stationeers Scripts Repository

This repository contains my collection of scripts for the Stationeers game. The scripts are written in the [ic11](https://github.com/Raibo/ic11/) language.

## Directory Structure

- **bin/**  
    Contains the original compiler and my modified version. The changes I made are documented in a [pull request](https://github.com/Raibo/ic11/pull/8) in the original repo.

- **out/**  
    Compiled assembly files generated by the original compiler.

- **pantos/**  
    Compiled assembly files generated by my modified compiler.

- **old_ic10/**  
    Archive of my original handwritten assembly scripts before porting to IC11.

## Building

Running `make` (using a windows bash environment like `git bash`) will compile all scripts using both compilers. The resulting assembly files are placed in the respective output directories (`out` for the original compiler, `pantos` for my version).
